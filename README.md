- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dtroiano23 Don Troiano Co-Founder of Our Fashion Passion, Inc and Market Pros International, Inc we are looking to fund our seed round for Our Fashion Passion as we have traction and are ready to take it to the next level.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web design, SEO, Copywriting (a dying art with AI taking over today)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Basic coding, cloud management and SEO
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Our Fashion Passion. We are looking for a developer who can lead a team to develop a native website since Our Fashion Passion is built on template and plugins that I do not trust in the long haul. 
- 📫 How to reach me shoot me an email dtroiano@marketprosdigital.com
